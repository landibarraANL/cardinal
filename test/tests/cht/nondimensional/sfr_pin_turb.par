# Model of single SFR pincell, fluid region only. All units are nondimensional.
# The following reference scales are selected:
#
# L = 0.908e-2
# rho = 834.5
# Pr = 0.004532565021024762
# U = 0.0950466                 inlet velocity from ../sfr_pincell
# T0 = 628.15                   inlet temperature from ../sfr_pincell
#
# The particular length scale selected is based on dividing the mesh in
# ../sfr_pincell by a factor of 0.908e-2 (the pin pitch)
