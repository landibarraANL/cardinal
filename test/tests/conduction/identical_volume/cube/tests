                  "nekRS. This problem does not really represent any interesting physical case, but "
                  "is solely intended to show that nekRS correctly solves the heat equation with a "

                  "MOOSE standalone case to within 0.1%. To keep the gold files small here, this test "
                  "is only performed on a 10x10x10 nekRS mesh."
