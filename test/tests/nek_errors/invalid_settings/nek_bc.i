# The mesh file used for nekRS (brick.re2) has six sidesets numbered
# as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. In the nekRS input file (brick.par), we set
# these six boundaries to have insulated, insulated, specified flux,
# insulated, insulated, and insulated boundary conditions, respectively.
# Based on the data transfers assumed in/out from nekRS, we should throw
# an error if a flux boundary condition is not specified on the boundary
# we set for NekRSMesh, because otherwise that heat flux condition would
# never get used.
