# Multiphysics Coupling of NekRS, OpenMC, and MOOSE

These tutorials describe how to combine NekRS, OpenMC, and MOOSE for
tightly-coupled multiphysics simulations.
Several examples are provided:

- [TRISO gas-cooled compact](triso_multiphysics.md)
- [SFR pincell](pincell_multiphysics.md)
- [MSFR](msfr.md)
