# Theory Manual

This page provides links to learn more about the mathematical theory
used in NekRS, OpenMC, and several common MOOSE codes that are referenced
throughout Cardinal tutorials and publications. For the most complete
descriptions of these codes, please refer to the code-specific documentation
pages for more information.

## MOOSE

MOOSE's theory manuals for various physics kernels are available on the
[MOOSE documentation website](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/modules/index.html).
Some common features used in Cardinal include:

- [Conservation of energy in solids](theory/heat_eqn.md)
- [1-D area-averaged Navier-Stokes](theory/thm.md)

## NekRS

NekRS's theory manual is available on the
[NekRS documentation website](https://nekrsdoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
Some common features used in Cardinal include:

- [Incompressible Navier-Stokes equations](theory/ins.md)
- [Solution in non-dimensional form](theory/nondimensional_ns.md)
- [k-tau RANS model](theory/ktau.md)
- [LES filtering](theory/les_filter.md)
